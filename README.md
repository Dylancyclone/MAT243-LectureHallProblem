# MAT 243: Lecture Hall Problem

This repository is my basic submission for the answer to Computer Question 5 from Chapter 8 (page 569) of the "Discrete Mathematics and Its Applications 7th Edition" Textbook by Kenneth H. Rosen, which reads:

>"Given a set of *n* talks, their start and end times, and the number of attendees at each talk, use dynamic programming to schedule a subset of these talks in a single lecture hall to maximize total attendance."

This repo aims to answer the question, explain the process behind it, and nothing more. It is not built to be full of features, nor is it built to be used in any scenario other than to answer this question.

The explaination for the answer is given in comments by the relavent code, but if for some reason you don't have access to syntax highlighting, it might be easier to read it [here](./Explanation.md) 

## How to run

If for some reason you want to run it, simply clone the repo, install all dependencies with `yarn install`, and run `yarn start`.
